# this tutorial is pretty out of date but it still works for me
# replace "version" with the current version

# Download and Extract the Discord tar.gz file from the official website.

sudo tar -xvzf discord-0.0.54.tar.gz -C /opt

# Create symlink

sudo ln -sf -v /opt/Discord/Discord /usr/bin/Discord

# add to apps

sudo cp -r -v /opt/Discord/discord.desktop /usr/share/applications

# Start it once...
# Restart the system to see the changes
# Now disable updating...

# Find discord directory:

ls -la `which discord`
 /usr/bin/discord -> ../share/discord/Discord

# find and update JSON file using sed command

find /usr/share/discord -name build_info.json -exec sudo sed -i.orig 's/\.9/\.10/' {} \;

# display both the updated JSON and backup ( original )

find /usr/share/discord -name build_info.* -ls -exec cat {} \; -exec echo \;

# start discord now

# hope this helps
# SK_
